Verafin Inc. has an exclusive advantage in using FRAMLx. This is a further enhancement and innovation to their Fraud detection and Anti-Money Laundering (FRAML) software which is powered by technology available only in the Verafin Cloud. It provides advanced cross-institutional analysis to detect suspicious activity across multiple financial institutions. This technology is the first of its kind to be offered by any fraud and AML software provider. 
FRAMLx has capability to identify suspicious activity that would otherwise go undetected thereby giving the financial institutions to gain more insight on how their client behave, collaborate in investigations undertaken and more accurately detect suspicious activities.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

•	Security metrics to comply with data protection regulations. Security metrics measure an organisation’s cybersecurity program is mainting regulatory compliance and meeting goals as to data security performance. (https://securityscorecard.com/blog/the-most-important-security-metrics-to-maintain-compliance). 

•	Lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR), and change fail percentage. (https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/four-key-metrics)

•	Key Performance Indicators (KPI) – measures how well a company is complying with applicable laws and regulations. (https://www.saiglobal.com/hub/blog/utilizing-metrics-to-substantiate-management-of-regchange) 

•	Key Risk Indicators (KRI) – natural extension of a KPI, where the organization wants to know how the most significant risks are affecting its ability to be in conformance. (https://www.saiglobal.com/hub/blog/utilizing-metrics-to-substantiate-management-of-regchange) 

•	Key Control Indicators (KCI) – measures how effective the controls are for each risk. These measures tie to the organisation’s appetite and tolerance levels, which are frequently very conservative with no tolerance for non-compliance.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

One service that RegTech providers should offer, if not already offered, is the capability of a coordinated approach to harmonizing compliance requirements across markets. The global nature of financial transactions these days require this. Although in most cases, regulations across different markets or jurisdictions may be similar, it will not be surprising to know that each market or jurisdiction may have distinct peculiarities that relevant parties may inadvertently fail to comply with because of oversight. I believe that this can be made possible when there is an enhanced data sharing among the regulators of the markets or jurisdictions across the globe and how the data are used. 

Another service or innovation is to develop a standardized reporting formats.  


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

In my view, the services mentioned above will be a growth driver for a safer and more secure global financial transactions. A regulatory tech company that is able to offer these services will be able to provide its clients the opportunity to be more competitive in the fintech space since it has full and broad visibility on the compliance regulations in markets where they offer their fintech products. It also provides abilities to financial institutions to control costs and risks in a more effective manner, liberate regulatory capital, and present opportunities to fintech startups. 

On the other hand, this service will provide regulators the capabilities to develop continuous-monitoring tools that are crucial in identifying problems as these develop. It will also enable regulators to reduce investigation time for compliance breaches and fosters the development of sandboxes and simulation systems which can provide them with insights as to the likely consequences of proposed reforms. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The technologies required for fintech are sandboxes and Application Program Interface (API).

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

API is a technology that allows multiple applications to interact with each other and obtain data from one another. 

The sandbox allows a financial institution to test new services that they are not currently authorized or licensed to offer or provide for a certain period of time.
